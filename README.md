J For Smile
===========

Sometimes you may notice that mail contain letter 'J' or 'K' or 'L' instead of a smiley.  This happens because
Microsoft Office (and related products like Outlook) automatically "correct" the ":)" smiley into a smiley graphic
in the Wingdings font.  This works well if you have Wingdings installed, but (draconian?) standards-compliant
browsers like Firefox and Chrome don't allow the use of non-standard fonts like wingdings (which isn't Unicode so
can't be standard).

This userscript written in JavaScript replaces these Wingdings characters in Gmail with a Yahoo Emoticon Smiley, 
like <img src="//l.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons7/1.gif">.
